When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people are working on the same project, or if its a huge repository in which only a small part is being worked on at any point in time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some changes might not actually be desirable e.g. a colleague accidentally introduced a bug; all changes should be checked before being pulled so they should be done manually. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are exclusively for use on GitHub's servers, clones are used when the destination is a local computer. Branches merely create a new line of commits.

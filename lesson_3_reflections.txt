When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people are working on the same project, or if its a huge repository in which only a small part is being worked on at any point in time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some changes might not actually be desirable e.g. a colleague accidentally introduced a bug; all changes should be checked before being pulled so they should be done manually.

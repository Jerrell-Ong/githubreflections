What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You can run git commands in it, otherwise the functions provided bit Git cannot be used. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate zone for files I'm about to add to the repository. It allows me to add files in sequence and remove them without having done a commit in the repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Empty the staging area into the repository after every logical change. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

New experimental features or different languages. Basically developments of code which you're unsure will work. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They give an overview of which commits are the most recent, which are reachable and what each branch does. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The changes incorporated by both branches are implemented in the new merged branch. This is represented on a diagram by two lines recombining because there is only one resultant branch.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You can run git commands in it, otherwise the functions provided bit Git cannot be used. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate zone for files I'm about to add to the repository. It allows me to add files in sequence and remove them without having done a commit in the repository.
